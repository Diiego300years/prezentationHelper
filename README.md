Hi in our presentation helper web app.
I wanted to learn more nodejs, Epress.js, yarn and my contributor Kacper- front technologies.

How to start? git clone ... than add 2 files I can send you priv:
package.json
yarn.lock.

With them both you can run command:  yarn add package.json

Than do ./start.sh.

Have a great fun!
